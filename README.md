# OhMyGPT

[ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README.zh.md)

OhMyGPT is a project that enables you to deploy a ChatGPT-based web app within minutes, by just configuring some environment variables. You will get a web app similar to the demos found on https://polisher.vercel.app and https://ohmyzhen.vercel.app.

To deploy your web app based on ChatGPT, you will require an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and an account in [Vercel](https://vercel.com). We plan to expand our support to include more cloud platforms in the future. However, currently, it has only been tested on Vercel.
